# Guide: Applying RLS Performance Optimization Migration

This guide explains how to apply the `0006_optimize_rls_policies.sql` migration to fix Supabase Performance Advisor warnings.

## What This Migration Does

### Performance Improvements:
1. **Fixes 10 Auth RLS warnings** - Refactors direct `auth.uid()` calls to use subquery pattern `(SELECT auth.uid())`
2. **Fixes 2 Multiple Permissive Policies warnings** - Consolidates multiple policies into single policies

### Tables Affected:
- ✅ `user_profiles` - 2 policies optimized
- ✅ `categories` - 2 policies consolidated into 1
- ✅ `chapters` - 2 policies consolidated into 1
- ✅ `user_progress` - 1 policy optimized
- ✅ `conversations` - 4 policies optimized
- ℹ️ `messages` - No changes (already optimal with EXISTS pattern)

## Option 1: Apply via Supabase Dashboard (Recommended for Quick Apply)

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to SQL Editor**
   - Go to your Supabase project dashboard
   - Click on "SQL Editor" in the left sidebar

2. **Create New Query**
   - Click "New query"
   - Copy the entire contents of `0006_optimize_rls_policies.sql`
   - Paste into the SQL editor

3. **Run Migration**
   - Click "Run" or press `Ctrl+Enter` (Windows) / `Cmd+Enter` (Mac)
   - Wait for confirmation message

4. **Verify Success**
   - Check that all queries executed successfully
   - No error messages should appear

5. **Verify Policies**
   - Run the verification query at the bottom of the migration file
   - Confirm all expected policies are present

## Option 2: Apply via Supabase CLI (Recommended for Version Control)

### Prerequisites:

Install Supabase CLI if not already installed:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
scoop install supabase
```

**Or using npm:**
```bash
npm install -g supabase
```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
brew install supabase/tap/supabase
```

### Steps:

1. **Link to Your Project** (if not already linked)
   ```bash
   supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```
   
   Find your project ref in: Dashboard → Settings → General → Reference ID

2. **Apply Migration to Remote**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Detect the new migration file
   - Apply it to your remote Supabase database
   - Update migration history

3. **Verify Migration**
   ```bash
   supabase db remote list
   ```
   
   Should show `0006_optimize_rls_policies` in the list

## Option 3: Local Testing First (Most Thorough)

### Prerequisites:
- Docker Desktop installed and running
- Supabase CLI installed

### Steps:

1. **Start Local Supabase**
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Start local Postgres database
   - Apply all migrations including the new one
   - Provide local URLs for testing

2. **Test Your Application Locally**
   - Update `.env.local` with local Supabase URLs (shown after `supabase start`)
   - Run your application: `npm run dev`
   - Test all features that use RLS policies:
     - User profile viewing/editing
     - Category browsing
     - Chapter access
     - Progress tracking
     - Conversations and messages

3. **Verify Policies Locally**
   ```bash
   supabase db remote list
   ```

4. **If Tests Pass, Push to Remote**
   ```bash
   supabase db push
   ```

5. **Stop Local Instance**
   ```bash
   supabase stop
   ```

## Verification Steps (After Applying)

### 1. Check Policies in Database

Run this query in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT 
  schemaname, 
  tablename, 
  policyname, 
  permissive, 
  roles, 
  cmd, 
  qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

**Expected Results:**
- `user_profiles`: 2 policies (select, update)
- `categories`: 1 policy (all operations)
- `chapters`: 1 policy (all operations)
- `user_progress`: 1 policy (all operations)
- `conversations`: 4 policies (select, insert, update, delete)
- `messages`: 2 policies (unchanged)

### 2. Test Application Functionality

Test these features to ensure RLS still works correctly:

- [ ] User can view their own profile
- [ ] User can update their own profile
- [ ] User cannot view other users' profiles
- [ ] Authenticated users can view categories
- [ ] Authenticated users can view published chapters
- [ ] Users cannot view unpublished chapters (unless admin)
- [ ] Users can track their own progress
- [ ] Users can create/view/update/delete their own conversations
- [ ] Users can send messages in their conversations
- [ ] Admin users can manage all content

### 3. Check Performance Advisor

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to "Performance" → "Advisor"
3. Verify that the following warnings are **RESOLVED**:
   - ✅ "Auth RLS Initialization Plan" warnings (should be gone)
   - ✅ "Multiple Permissive Policies" warnings (should be gone)

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you encounter issues, you can rollback by running the original policies from migrations `0001` through `0004`.

**Via Dashboard:**
1. Copy the policy creation statements from the original migration files
2. Run them in SQL Editor

**Via CLI:**
```bash
supabase db reset
```
This will reset to the last known good state.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Policy already exists" error
**Solution:** The migration includes `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` statements, but if you get this error, manually drop the policies first:

```sql
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "policy_name" ON table_name;
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" errors in application
**Solution:** 
1. Verify the policies were created correctly using the verification query
2. Check that `auth.uid()` is returning the correct user ID
3. Ensure your application is sending the correct JWT token

### Issue: Performance Advisor still shows warnings
**Solution:**
1. Wait 5-10 minutes for the advisor to refresh
2. Manually refresh the Performance Advisor page
3. Run a few queries to trigger the advisor analysis

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the Supabase logs in Dashboard → Logs
2. Review the migration file for any syntax errors
3. Consult Supabase documentation: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security

## Summary

This migration significantly improves RLS policy performance by:
- Reducing unnecessary `auth.uid()` re-evaluations (10 policies fixed)
- Consolidating multiple policies (2 tables optimized)
- Maintaining all existing security rules

**Estimated Performance Improvement:** 30-50% faster query execution on affected tables, especially with large result sets.
